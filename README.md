This repo features Intoxication analysis using eyes.
In this project, I aimed to achieve whether the given image of an eye is intoxicated or not. I looked at constricted and dilated pupils which are caused by side effects of the various drugs.
The algorithm used here is not deep learning but Machine Learning algorithms.
The ones which provided me the best accuracy is the Logistic Regression and the Naive Bayes algorithms. 
Finally to end my work, I deployed this on a localhost server using streamlit. The file appdep.py is the one.
